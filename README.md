Last update : 2023/01/31

Native [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) and [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com) connector for PHP based on the CQL binary protocol (v3),
without the need for an external extension.

Requires [PHP](https://www.php.net/) version >5, Cassandra >1.2, and any ScyllaDB version.

Installation
------------

Either:

* Via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```bash
$ composer require uri2x/php-cql
```
OR

* Copy `Cassandra.php` to your project and include it.

Important
---------

Make sure you turn on the native transport for Cassandra by editing your
cassandra.yaml file and adding the following line:

    start_native_transport: true

Usage
-----

#### Available methods

connect($host, $user = '', $passwd = '', $dbname = '', $port = 9042)

    Connects to a Cassandra node.

    @param string $host   Host name/IP to connect to use 'p:' as prefix for persistent connections.
    @param string $user   Username in case authentication is needed.
    @param string $passwd Password in case authentication is needed.
    @param string $dbname Keyspace to use upon connection.
    @param int    $port   Port to connect to.
    @param int    $retries: Number of connection retries (default: 3, useful for persistent connections in case of timeouts).

    @return int The socket descriptor used. FALSE if unable to connect.

close()

    Closes an opened connection.

    @return int 1

query($cql, $consistency = CASSANDRA_CONSISTENCY_ALL)

    Queries the database using the given CQL.

    @param string $cql         The query to run.
    @param int    $consistency Consistency level for the operation.

    @return array Result of the query. Might be an array of rows (for SELECT),
                  or the operation's result (for USE, CREATE, ALTER, UPDATE).
                  NULL on error.

prepare($cql)

    Prepares a query.

    @param string $cql The query to prepare.

    @return array The statement's information to be used with the execute
                  method. NULL on error.


execute($stmt, $values, $consistency = CASSANDRA_CONSISTENCY_ALL)

    Executes a prepared statement.

    @param array $stmt        The prepared statement as returned from the
                              prepare method.
    @param array $values      Values to bind in key=>value format where key is
                              the column's name.
    @param int   $consistency Consistency level for the operation.

    @return array Result of the execution. Might be an array of rows (for
                  SELECT), or the operation's result (for USE, CREATE, ALTER,
                  UPDATE).
                  NULL on error.
#### Procedural
In addition, a wrapper has been made for those who prefer to work with
procedural programming. To use the wrapper, make sure to include
`Cassandra_Procedural.php` that contains the following methods:

cassandra_connect($host, $user = '', $passwd = '', $dbname = '', $port = 9042)

    Same as $Cassandra->connect() above. Returns an object type if connection
    was successfull. Otherwise returns NULL.

cassandra_close($obj)

    Same as $Cassandra->close() above. Use $obj from cassandra_connect as the
    first parameter.

cassandra_query($obj, $cql, $consistency = CASSANDRA_CONSISTENCY_ALL)

    Same as $Cassandra->query() above. Use $obj from cassandra_connect as the
    first parameter.

cassandra_prepare($obj, $cql)

    Same as $Cassandra->prepare() above. Use $obj from cassandra_connect as the
    first parameter.

cassandra_execute($obj, $stmt, $values, $consistency = CASSANDRA_CONSISTENCY_ALL)

    Same as $Cassandra->execute() above. Use $obj from cassandra_connect as the
    first parameter.


Sample usage
------------
```php

<?php

require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

$obj = new CassandraNative\Cassandra();

// Connects to the node:
$res = $obj->connect('127.0.0.1', 'my_user', 'my_pass', 'my_keyspace');

// Tests if the connection was successful:
if ($res)
{
    // Queries a table:
    $arr = $obj->query('SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM my_table');

    // $arr, for example, can contain:
    // Array
    // (
    //     [0] => Array
    //         (
    //             [col1] => first row
    //             [col2] => 1
    //             [col3] => 0x111111
    //         )
    //
    //     [1] => Array
    //         (
    //             [col1] => second row
    //             [col2] => 2
    //             [col3] => 0x222222
    //         )
    //
    // )

    // Prepares a statement:
    $stmt = $obj->prepare('UPDATE my_table SET col2=?,col3=? where col1=?');

    // Executes a prepared statement:
    $values = ['col2' => 5, 'col3' => '0x55', 'col1' => 'five'];
    $pResult = $obj->execute($stmt, $values);

    // Upon success, $pResult would be:
    // Array
    // (
    //     [0] => Array
    //         (
    //             [result] => success
    //         )
    //
    // )

    // Closes the connection:
    $obj->close();
}
```
or, same as above in procedural style:
```php
// Connects to the node:
$handle = cassandra_connect('127.0.0.1', 'my_user', 'my_pass', 'my_keyspace');

// Tests if the connection was successful:
if ($handle)
{
    // Queries a table:
    $arr = cassandra_query($handle, 'SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM my_table');

    // Prepares a statement:
    $stmt = cassandra_prepare($handle,
        'UPDATE my_table SET col2=?,col3=? WHERE col1=?');

    // Executes a prepared statement:
    $values = ['col2' => 5, 'col3' => '0x55', 'col1' => 'five'];
    $pResult = cassandra_execute($handle, $stmt, $values);

    // Closes the connection:
    cassandra_close($handle);
}
```
